KICKOFF: HTML Generator Component Update Review

CONTEXT:
The dangerous defects insights generator (generate_dangerous_defects_insights.py) was updated to fix survivorship bias in SQL queries. The JSON output structure may have subtle changes that could affect the HTML generator components.

TASK:
Review the changes documented in CHANGELOG_2026-01-03.md and verify that all HTML generator components in the components/ folder correctly handle the updated JSON data.

FILES TO REVIEW:

1. Reference documentation:
   scripts/dangerous_defects/CHANGELOG_2026-01-03.md

2. Data parser (handles JSON parsing):
   scripts/dangerous_defects/components/data_parser.py

3. Updated JSON output:
   scripts/dangerous_defects/dangerous_defects_insights.json

4. Original JSON (for comparison):
   scripts/dangerous_defects/dangerous_defects_insights_BEFORE.json

SPECIFIC CONCERNS:

1. The by_model_year data in vehicle deep dives now aggregates across fuel types (was split before causing duplicates). Check if data_parser.py or section_deep_dives.py needs adjustment.

2. Vehicle variant counts now include fuel_type in the count. Verify any display logic handles this.

3. Some test counts slightly increased (e.g., diesel: 136,598,392 -> 136,598,497). Ensure no hardcoded values exist.

4. Vehicles with zero dangerous defects could now appear in safest lists (currently none meet thresholds, but future-proof the display logic).

COMMANDS TO RUN:

# Regenerate insights
python scripts/dangerous_defects/generate_dangerous_defects_insights.py

# Regenerate HTML
python scripts/dangerous_defects/generate_dangerous_defects_html.py

# Compare JSON structure
python -c "import json; b=json.load(open('scripts/dangerous_defects/dangerous_defects_insights_BEFORE.json')); a=json.load(open('scripts/dangerous_defects/dangerous_defects_insights.json')); print('Keys match:', b.keys() == a.keys())"
