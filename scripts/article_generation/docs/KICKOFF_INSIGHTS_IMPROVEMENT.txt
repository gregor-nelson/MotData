KICKOFF: Article Generation Insights Quality Improvement

Reference Document: scripts/article_generation/docs/PRD_SPECIFICATION.md

CONTEXT
-------
The article generation component currently enforces minimum test thresholds (500-1000 tests) to ensure statistical validity. This works well for high-volume makes like Ford and Toyota but results in sparse or empty articles for low-volume manufacturers like Lamborghini, Ferrari, and other premium/niche brands.

DISCUSSION TOPICS
-----------------

1. LOW-VOLUME MAKE HANDLING
   Current: Data excluded if below threshold, sections skipped entirely

   Questions to explore:
   - Should we display low-volume data with confidence indicators?
   - Could we aggregate across similar models or years to reach thresholds?
   - Should premium makes have different threshold tiers?
   - How do we communicate statistical uncertainty to users?

2. PREMIUM CUSTOMER VALUE
   Current: Same insights generated for all makes regardless of market segment

   Questions to explore:
   - What additional insights would premium car buyers find valuable?
   - Should we include cost-of-failure analysis for expensive repairs?
   - Would comparisons within luxury segment be more relevant than national averages?
   - Are there premium-specific failure patterns worth highlighting?

3. DATA PRESENTATION OPTIONS

   Ideas to consider:
   - Tiered confidence labels (high/medium/low based on sample size)
   - Aggregated "luxury segment" benchmarks instead of national
   - Model family groupings (all 911 variants combined)
   - Historical trend focus over absolute pass rates
   - Peer comparison (Lamborghini vs Ferrari vs McLaren)

4. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

   Current thresholds from PRD:
   - MIN_TESTS_PROVEN: 500 (durability champions)
   - MIN_TESTS_EARLY: 1000 (early performers)
   - MIN_TESTS_CORE_MODEL: 500 (model inclusion)

   What statistical validity do we need to maintain?

GOALS FOR THIS SESSION
----------------------
- Define acceptable confidence levels for low-volume data display
- Identify premium-specific insights worth implementing
- Agree on presentation approach for uncertain data
- Prioritise improvements for next iteration
