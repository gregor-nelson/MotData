Top performer

The GT achieves a 95.4% pass rate, 24 percentage points above the national average.

Proven Durability Champions: Which Ford Models Age Best?
These Ford models have proven exceptional durability with 11+ years of real-world MOT data. They consistently outperform the national average for cars of the same age:

Overall Ford Durability Rating:
Average
High-confidence data: Only vehicles with 11+ years of MOT history and 100+ tests are included in this ranking.

Model	Year	Fuel	vs Same-Age Average	Tested At	Pass Rate
ANGLIA	-	All	+33.7%	21+ years	94.8%
POPULAR	-	All	+30.6%	21+ years	91.7%
F150	-	All	+27.2%	18-20 years	83.3%
CORTINA	-	All	+27.1%	21+ years	88.2%
MUSTANG	-	All	+26.7%	15-17 years	84.6%
SIERRA	-	All	+24.0%	21+ years	85.0%
MUSTANG	-	All	+21.8%	18-20 years	77.9%
CAPRI	-	All	+21.3%	21+ years	82.3%
MUSTANG	-	All	+20.9%	21+ years	82.0%
GRANADA	-	All	+19.8%	21+ years	80.9%
How to read this: A score of "+15%" means the model passes MOTs 15 percentage points more often than the average car of the same age. These are proven results from vehicles that have genuinely aged well.

Proven durability champion

The ANGLIA outperforms the average 21+ years-old car by 34 percentage points, with 248 MOT tests proving its reliability.

Early Performers: Strong Start, Unproven Durability
These newer Ford models (3-6 years old) show strong early results, but haven't yet proven long-term durability:

Important caveat: Durability NOT yet proven - too early to assess long-term reliability. Older versions of the same model may tell a different story at 11+ years.

Model	Year	Fuel	vs Same-Age Average	Tested At	Pass Rate
BENIMAR	-	All	+8.4%	3-7 years	93.2%
EDGE	-	All	+8.1%	8-10 years	83.5%
PUMA	-	All	+8.1%	3-7 years	92.8%
AUTO-TRAIL	-	All	+7.5%	3-7 years	92.2%
MUSTANG	-	All	+6.7%	8-10 years	82.1%
UNCLASSIFIED	-	All	+6.2%	8-10 years	81.6%
ROLLER TEAM	-	All	+5.7%	3-7 years	90.5%
FREEDOM	-	All	+4.9%	8-10 years	80.3%
What this means: These models are performing well in their early years, but we recommend checking the Durability Champions section above to see how older versions of the same model family have fared over time.

Ford Hybrids vs Petrol vs Diesel
Reliability varies by fuel type for Ford. Here's how each performs:

Fuel Type	Average Pass Rate	vs National	Tests
ST	100.0%	+28.6%	1
LN	100.0%	+28.6%	2
FC	100.0%	+28.6%	1
CN	100.0%	+28.6%	3
Hybrid Electric	88.6%	+17.1%	6,381
Plug-in Hybrid	87.3%	+15.9%	166
Electric	84.8%	+13.3%	505
GD	83.3%	+11.9%	6
Gas Bi-fuel	70.2%	-1.2%	47
Petrol	69.3%	-2.1%	2,547,911
Diesel	67.3%	-4.1%	1,917,341
GA	65.2%	-6.2%	23
LP	62.3%	-9.1%	679
Other	50.0%	-21.4%	8
The hybrid advantage: Ford hybrids pass MOTs 19% more often than petrols and 21% more often than diesels.

Ford Models to Avoid
Not all Fords are reliable. These specific model/year combinations have failure rates well above average:

Model	Year	Fuel	Pass Rate	Tests
TOURNEO CONNECT	2005	Diesel	37.5%	72
FOCUS	1998	Petrol	46.4%	110
TRANSIT COURIER	2015	Petrol	58.3%	96
TOURNEO CUSTOM 320 ZETEC EBLUE	2020	Diesel	70.8%	250
TRANSIT CUSTOM 340 TREND EBLUE	2020	Diesel	70.8%	72
TRANSIT CUSTOM 300LEADER EBLUE	2021	Diesel	74.4%	82
FIESTA	2016	Diesel	62.5%	11,964
TRANSIT CUSTOM 300LEADER EBLUE	2020	Diesel	71.7%	4,587
TRANSIT	2012	Diesel	50.0%	16,374
TRANSIT CONNECT	2018	Petrol	68.7%	230
Pattern to avoid

Early 2020-2021 diesel TRANSIT CUSTOM 300LEADER EBLUEs are the models that drag down Ford's average. The CONNECT performs 17% worse than the average car of the same age at 15-17 years - this is proven poor durability. These vehicles fail MOTs more often than they pass.

About This Data
This analysis uses real MOT test results from the DVSA database, covering 4,473,074 tests on Ford vehicles between 2000 and 2023.

Year-Adjusted Scoring (v2.1): In year-by-year breakdowns, each vehicle is compared against the national average for vehicles of the same model year. This removes the natural bias where newer cars pass more often, allowing fair comparisons across eras.

Evidence-Tiered Durability: We separate "proven durability" (vehicles tested at 11+ years old) from "early performers" (3-6 years old). Only vehicles with proven long-term data are used for durability claims. Age-band comparisons use weighted national averages.

Minimum thresholds: 100 tests for proven durability rankings, 100 tests for early performer rankings. Pass rates are calculated as first-time passes, excluding retests.

The overall national average MOT pass rate is 71.45% based on 32.3 million tests across all manufacturers. Year-specific averages range from ~59% (2009 vehicles) to ~88% (2020 vehicles).
